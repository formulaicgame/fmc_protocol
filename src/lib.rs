// TODO: I want to increase block ids from u16 to u32. Doubling the memory size is bad. Instead
// replace the blocks a chunk holds with substitutes, and keep a mapping from substitute values to
// block ids. Then you can have 'lookup: Vec<BlockId>' and 'blocks: Vec<u16>', take the value you want
// from 'blocks' cast it to usize and index into the lookup with it, you now have the block id.
// This may even allow reducing the in-transit size by using even smaller types. I need to measure
// but I assume most chunks don't consist of more than a handful of blocks. Maybe it can go all the
// way down to 4 bits per block for most chunks, in which case keeping it in memory is a good trade
// off for not having to build the representation each time it is sent.
//
// TODO: Should probably define BlockState here too, to avoid hard to parse u16's and easier to
// change data type.

/// Storage type of blocks.
